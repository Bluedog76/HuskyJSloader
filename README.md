# HuskyJSloader
A Repository for JsDeliver.

# Current Scripts

## Edpuzzle Cheats 

(I made an edit so that it only uses JsDeliver as Github raw was blocked on my school network)

### Links

https://github.com/Bluedog76/HuskyJSloader/Scripts/Edpuzzle.js
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bluedog76/HuskyJSloader/Scripts/Edpuzzle.js

### Exuction code (Put in bookmark!)

javascript: fetch("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Bluedog76/HuskyJSloader@main/Scripts/Edpuzzle.js").then(r => r.text()).then(r => eval(r))

## Legacy Webstore
This is likely gonna be patched but according to a redit post (I found on the day on 4/12/24)
You can add a describter to the end of the webstore link to get it to work. Ie.
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/app/8-education?hl=en
## Thinking of making a port for Car axle but it talks to github a lot more than edpuzzle cheats :/

## More to come. Free for Suggestions :D
